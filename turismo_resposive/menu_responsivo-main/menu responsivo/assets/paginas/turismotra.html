               <p class="tamanho">In Foz do Iguaçu it is possible to learn more about religions that are not very widespread in Brazil. The Sunni Muslim Omar Ibn Al-Khattab Mosque, built from 1981, offers guided tours with a
                very interesting programming.<br>
       
                As they are Sunni, there are prayers during the day – and at these times visits are not allowed. As in the Catholic religion, in which the churches have a bell, the mosque has a call,
                which is done with the human voice itself. Guided by the Koran, the religion has customs that are different from those Brazilians are used to, such as the fact that men and women pray in spaces
                separated.</p>
